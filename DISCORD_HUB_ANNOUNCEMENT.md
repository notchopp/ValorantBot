Yo! The GRNDS hub is live. 

Head to **hub.grnds.xyz** to sign in with Discord and see all your stats, MMR progression, match history, and where you rank on the leaderboard. Everything from the Discord bot is now in one clean dashboard you can check anytime.

**How to use it:**
1. Go to hub.grnds.xyz
2. Sign in with Discord (automatically links to your player profile)
3. Check your dashboard for personal stats, view the leaderboard, see the current season, and check out other players' profiles

You can still use all the Discord commands like before - `/progress`, `/rank`, `/leaderboard`, etc. The hub is just another way to view everything in one place. Same data, same system, just more convenient to check when you're not in Discord.

**Marvel Rivals features are coming soon.** We're working on bringing the same ranked system and stats tracking to Marvel Rivals. Same vibe, different game. Stay tuned.

Let's run it up. 🔥
