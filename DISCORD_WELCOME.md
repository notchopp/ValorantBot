Yo! Welcome to **#GRNDS**. This is a passion project of mine I built to make ranked fun again. Everything you see here is custom made by me for you, from the matchmaking to the MMR system to every single command you'll use.

This isn't your typical Discord server. We run our own custom rank system with real MMR tracking, automatic role assignments, and commands that actually make grinding feel rewarding. No more waiting for Riot to fix their ranked system, we made our own.

**Quick start:**
1. Link your Riot account with `/riot link`
2. Get verified and placed with `/verify`
3. Queue up with `/queue join` and start climbing

**Want to see where you're at?**
Use `/progress` to see your rank progression, `/streak` to check if you're on fire or tilted, `/history` to review your recent games, or `/compare @someone` to see how you stack up.

**Chasing X rank?**
Use `/xwatch` to see the top 10 players and where you need to be. Only the best make it to X rank (3000+ MMR), and it's always the top 10. Crown emoji for #1.

Check out **WELCOME.md** for the full comprehensive guide covering all commands, usage limits, rank tiers, and how the system works. Everything you need to know is in there.

Commands are there to be used, not spammed, but we encourage checking your stats and progression as much as you want. Most commands are instant, just be reasonable. `/agent` is daily limited when it drops since it's AI powered.

Let's make ranked competitive again. Grind hard, climb fast, and don't let losses keep you down. Every X rank player started at GRNDS I.

**Now queue up.** 🔥
