# ABSOLUTE Rank System

## Overview

The #GRNDS rank system features a dynamic competitive structure with traditional progression ranks and elite competitive tiers. The **ABSOLUTE** and **X** ranks represent the pinnacle of competitive play, creating a dynamic "bubble" where top players compete for limited positions.

## Rank Hierarchy

### Traditional Progression Ranks

1. **GRNDS** (I-V)
   - Entry rank for new players
   - Foundation of the competitive ladder

2. **BREAKPOINT** (I-V)
   - Intermediate competitive tier
   - Represents significant skill progression

3. **CHALLENGER** (I-III)
   - Advanced competitive tier
   - Requires consistent high-level performance
   - **CHALLENGER III** serves as the gateway to ABSOLUTE eligibility

### Elite Competitive Ranks

4. **ABSOLUTE**
   - **Eligibility:** CHALLENGER III with 2600+ MMR
   - **Position Range:** Leaderboard positions #11 - #20
   - **Dynamic Competition:** Players compete within the CHALLENGER III+ bracket for these 10 spots
   - **Status:** Elite tier representing top 20 players

5. **X**
   - **Eligibility:** 3000+ MMR
   - **Position Range:** Leaderboard positions #1 - #10
   - **Dynamic Competition:** ABSOLUTE players compete for these top 10 spots
   - **Status:** Ultimate rank representing the absolute best players

## ABSOLUTE Edition - Competitive Bubble System

### How It Works

The **ABSOLUTE** rank creates a competitive "bubble" system where:

1. **Eligibility Pool:**
   - All players at CHALLENGER III (2600+ MMR) are eligible for ABSOLUTE
   - Players must maintain minimum MMR threshold to remain eligible

2. **Rank Assignment:**
   - Leaderboard positions #11-#20 are assigned **ABSOLUTE** rank
   - Positions are determined by current MMR and leaderboard standing
   - Rankings update dynamically as players gain/lose MMR

3. **Competitive Dynamics:**
   - Players in CHALLENGER III can push into ABSOLUTE by climbing the leaderboard
   - ABSOLUTE players can drop back to CHALLENGER III if they fall below #20
   - ABSOLUTE players compete with each other and X-eligible players for top positions

4. **X Rank Competition:**
   - ABSOLUTE players with 3000+ MMR compete for X rank (top 10)
   - X rank players can drop to ABSOLUTE if they fall below #10
   - Creates constant competition at the highest level

### Key Features

- **MMR Floor Requirements:**
  - ABSOLUTE: 2600+ MMR (CHALLENGER III minimum)
  - X: 3000+ MMR
  
- **Leaderboard-Based:**
  - Ranks are determined by leaderboard position, not just MMR
  - Ensures only the most active and competitive players hold elite ranks
  
- **Dynamic Movement:**
  - Players can move between CHALLENGER III ↔ ABSOLUTE ↔ X based on performance
  - No static assignments - constant competition for limited spots

- **Quality Assurance:**
  - MMR floors ensure rank quality
  - Leaderboard position ensures competitive activity
  - Prevents rank inflation and maintains prestige

   - Players can always push for higher positions

5. **Prestige and Recognition:**
   - ABSOLUTE and X ranks represent true elite status
   - Limited availability increases rank value
